### **Goal of this lab is to get shell or steal data from the lab : **

- About the lab page : 
	-  Its about redirecting the vehicle further from the current position.
	- ![[command injection lab showing the vehicle postion.png]]
	- So if we did want to redirect the vehicle then we will need vehicle reg and new position for the vehicle.
	- For example - if i where to redirect the car position to X : 10, Y : 10 then it will be like this : 
		- ![[command injection veh redirect lab.png]]
		- Then after submitting we get the new position for that vehicle.
			- ![[command injection veh redirect output.png]]
		-  `![[Pasted image 20260117143007.png]]`
		- ` Executed: awk 'BEGIN {print sqrt(((100-10)^2) + ((200-10)^2))}'`

-  **Now lets check if the command injection is possible on this lab :**
	-  We can check by doing `pwd` command injection : 
		-  So we have to find a field where we could possible type our payload.
			-   If we check the image again ![[command injection veh redirect output.png]]
			-  Based of the image : Position X = `100 - 10 ^ 2` and the other one is Position Y, and then the result. Now we could type our payload with the input for Position y.
				-  We will use `seperators`  `&&`, `||`, `|`, `;`.

		-  Now if we type `10;whoami;#` in Position Y we won't possible get any results
