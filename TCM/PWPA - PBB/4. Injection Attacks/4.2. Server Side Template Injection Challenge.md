-  ![[ssti 0x02 challenge lab.png]]

### **Goal of this Lab :** 
	1. Check if SSTi is working.
	2. Try to see if payloads are working.
	3. Get Shell if possible.

### **verify if ssti is working :**
-  Since we know the lab uses `TWIG` Template Engine.
	-  We will straight up use this payload `{{7*7}}`
		-  ![[ssti challenge 0x02.png]]
		- If you look the payload is straight up display in the edit card part.  
			-  Then **we can it is CSTI,** but wait, do always check the inspect of HTML code in burp repeater.

			- Now if u look in the above code we can tell that SSTI is working that we got `Dear 49` instead of `Dear {{7*7}}.`
### **try other payloads  :**
-  `{{['cat\x20/etc/passwd']|filter('system')}}` : 
	-  ![[etcpasswd in ssti challenge.png]]
