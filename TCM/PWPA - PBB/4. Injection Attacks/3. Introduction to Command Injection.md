### **What is Command Injection ?**

-  Command injection is a **vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate an application to execute arbitrary system commands** on the server. 
- This occurs **when an application passes unsafe data**, often user input, to a system shell.

**A simple example**

A vulnerable web application might take a path from a query parameter and use it to read a file, like so:

```
$file = $_GET['file'];
system("cat /var/www/html/$file");
```

If an attacker uses a payload such as `; ls -la` in the `file` parameter, they can make the application execute an additional command that lists all files in the current directory.

The server then executes the `cat` command and the `ls` command and the attacker receives a list of all files in the current directory.
