- ![[command inecjtion lab 0x01.png]]
#### **Steps to perform :** 
 
 -  Check if command injection is working, 
	 -  As seen in the above image, it is shown that  it is curling the target that we give in the input box  ` curl -I -s -L http://localhost ; whoami | grep "HTTP/" `, 

	-  So if i where to type and enter `http://localhost`, it will curl it and grep out the `HTTP` information.
