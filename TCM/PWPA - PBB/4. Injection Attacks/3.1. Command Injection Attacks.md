### Goal of this LAB to get reverse connection : 

#### Before : 

- ![[command inecjtion lab 0x01.png]]
#### **Steps to perform :** 
 
 -  Check if command injection is working, 
	 -  As seen in the above image, it is shown that  it is curling the target that we give in the input box  ` curl -I -s -L http://localhost ; whoami | grep "HTTP/" `, 

	-  So if i where to type and enter `http://localhost`, it will curl it and grep out the `HTTP` information.

- Now lets see if we can return the current `pwd` : 
	-  So wat we have to do is give `pwd command` with the actually input that is `http:localhost ; pwd `  or `localhost ; pwd`, and we can actually see it does return the current pwd.  

>  INFACT you can type anything in the input. since we now the working of that input box. that is
>      -  valve in input box becomes as the input for the curl command.

-   **So wat happens is :**
	-  `input ; pwd #`  --> it become curl (input) ; pwd # | grep "HTTP/"
		-  if the input value is not valid then it skips and runs the other part that is `pwd` and the ' # ' commented out the  `grep` pipeline.
	-  You can use any separators : `;`  ,  `||`  ,  `|`  , `&&`

#####  Useful commands
-  After you identify an OS command injection vulnerability, it's useful to execute some initial commands to obtain information about the system. Below is a summary of some commands that are useful on Linux and Windows platforms:

| Purpose of command    | Linux         | Windows         |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Name of current user  | `whoami`      | `whoami`        |
| Operating system      | `uname -a`    | `ver`           |
| Network configuration | `ifconfig`    | `ipconfig /all` |
| Network connections   | `netstat -an` | `netstat -an`   |
| Running processes     | `ps -ef`      | `tasklist`      |
