### **Command Injection Lab 0x02** 

![[client command injection.png]]
-   To be accurate this is **CLIENT COMMAND INJECTION.**
	- **Command injection that runs on the USER'S computer** (not the server)
	- **Target**: User's browser/OS when they visit malicious site
	- **Impact**: Compromise user's machine
-  What ever we did in lab 1 which is server based command injection, won't work here.


-  So here we have to use something called **Backticks** also called as **Command Substitution**
	- **What it does**: Executes command inside backticks and replaces with output

- **WORKING :**

-  NORMAL USAGE : 

```
# Backticks execute command and use its output
echo "Today is `date`"
# Result: "Today is Fri Jan 16 17:45:00 UTC 2026"
```
