### **Command Injection Lab 0x02** 

![[client command injection.png]]
-   To be accurate this is **CLIENT COMMAND INJECTION.**
	- **Command injection that runs on the USER'S computer** (not the server)
	- **Target**: User's browser/OS when they visit malicious site
	- **Impact**: Compromise user's machine
-  What ever we did in lab 1 which is server based command injection, won't work here.


-  So here we have to use something called **Backticks** also called as **Command Substitution**
	- **What it does**: Executes command inside backticks and replaces with output

- **WORKING :**

	-  **NORMAL USAGE :** 

		```
		# Backticks execute command and use its output
		echo "Today is `date`"
		# Result: "Today is Fri Jan 16 17:45:00 UTC 2026"
		```

	- **Command Injection Example:**

		```
		# Vulnerable: ping `user_input`
		# User inputs: `whoami`
		# Becomes: ping `whoami` → ping www-data
		```

-  Testing this : 
	-  We will test it with sleep command --> if `True` then we can say client command injection is working.
	- ![[backticks working on client command injection.png]]
		-  As seen in the above image, the site loading, which means the payload is working that is `ping?q= `sleep 10` `.

-  Another way is we could use WEBHOOK to exfiltrate the data : [Webhook . site](https://webhook.site/#!/)

-  GET data like `/etc/passwd
