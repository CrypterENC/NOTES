### **Stored XSS : Script is stored on server (comments, profiles, forums)**

#### Lab -- XSS 0x02

-  For this lab, since its stored based, i will use **Firefox Mutliple Account Container**, so that i can open the lab from 2 separate acc's, so that it can simulate accounts belonging to 2 individuals.

- ![[showing 2 seperate acc containers..png]]

-  Now we have to Check if the XSS is Stored Based we have to perform `HTML INJECTION` .

-  To check that : 
	-  Goto XSS 0x02 in the 2 acc container, and type `<h1>Testing if HTML INJECTION IS WORKING</h1>` and submit. and reload the page and check  if it is present, if yes, then you have Stored XSS Vulnerably.
