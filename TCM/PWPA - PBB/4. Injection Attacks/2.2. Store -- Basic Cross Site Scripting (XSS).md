### **Stored XSS : Script is stored on server (comments, profiles, forums)**

#### Lab -- XSS 0x02

-  For this lab, since its stored based, i will use **Firefox Mutliple Account Container**, so that i can open the lab from 2 separate acc's, so that it can simulate accounts belonging to 2 individuals.

- ![[showing 2 seperate acc containers..png]]

-  Now we have to Check if the XSS is Stored Based we have to perform `HTML INJECTION` .
