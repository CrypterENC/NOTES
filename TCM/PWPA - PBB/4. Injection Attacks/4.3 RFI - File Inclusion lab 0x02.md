### **Steps to perform**

1. Do basic path traversal : 
   - ` ../../../../../etc/passwd `
   - If you are getting error while using basic path traversal, then you will have to bypass it, it gets filtered out. ( Reason being: at the server side the URL is getting encoded.  if u are sending  `..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd`  or  `..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252F..%252Fetc%252Fpasswd` the server is decoding it back to `../../../../../etc/passwd`. )
