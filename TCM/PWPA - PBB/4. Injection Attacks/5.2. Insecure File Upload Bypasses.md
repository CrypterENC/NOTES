### Insecure File upload Lab 0x02

-  **How is this lab diff from lab 1** :
	- Here once you upload a text file instead of a image file. the server validates it. that is even if you bypass the validation by changing the `filename=""` in burp suite it won't work.  

- **So how do we do it.**
-  Open request in burp.
