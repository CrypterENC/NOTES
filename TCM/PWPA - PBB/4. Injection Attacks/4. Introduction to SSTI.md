### **What is SSTI -- ( Server side Template injection ) ?** 
-  **SSTI = Server-Side Template Injection**

- **Injection** into **templates** that run on the **server**    
- Templates are used to generate HTML (like PHP, Jinja2, Twig)
- You inject code that gets **executed during template rendering**
#### **Before understanding wat is SSTI, lets understand Template Engine ?**
-  So it allows us to **separate the presentation layer from the logic layer in our application**, we can insert variables or sometimes even add complex logic directly into the templates. which then gets rendered into the website through **HTML.**.

- Or **it is used to dynamically generate HTML, XML or other formats. While they often have sandboxing features to limit the effects of template injection, these can sometimes be bypassed.**
