## Confidentiality Statement

This document is the exclusive property of [Company Name] and [Your Company/TCM Security]. This document contains proprietary and confidential information. Duplication, redistribution, or use, in whole or in part, in any form, requires consent of both parties.

[Your Company] may share this document with auditors under non-disclosure agreements to demonstrate penetration test requirement compliance.

## Disclaimer

A penetration test is considered a snapshot in time. The findings and recommendations reflect the information gathered during the assessment and not any changes or modifications made outside of that period.

Time-limited engagements do not allow for a full evaluation of all security controls. [Your Company] prioritized the assessment to identify the weakest security controls an attacker would exploit. [Your Company] recommends conducting similar assessments on an annual basis by internal or third-party assessors to ensure the continued success of the controls.

## Assessment Overview

From [Start Date] to [End Date], [Company Name] engaged [Your Company] to evaluate the security posture of its web application infrastructure compared to current industry best practices. All testing performed is based on the **NIST SP 800-115 Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment**, **OWASP Testing Guide (v4)**, and customized testing frameworks.

### Phases of Penetration Testing Activities

1. **Planning** – Customer goals are gathered and rules of engagement obtained.
2. **Discovery** – Perform scanning and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities, weak areas, and exploits.
3. **Attack** – Confirm potential vulnerabilities through exploitation and perform additional discovery upon new access.
4. **Reporting** – Document all found vulnerabilities and exploits, failed attempts, and company strengths and weaknesses.

## Assessment Components

### Web Application Penetration Test

A web application penetration test evaluates the security of web-based applications by simulating real-world attacks. The assessment identifies vulnerabilities in application logic, authentication mechanisms, session management, input validation, and access controls. Testing includes both automated scanning and manual testing techniques to uncover security flaws that could be exploited by malicious actors.

The assessment covers:
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Session management
- Input validation and injection vulnerabilities
- Business logic flaws
- Client-side security controls
- API security
- Configuration and deployment issues

## Finding Severity Ratings

The following table defines levels of severity and corresponding CVSS score range that are used throughout the document to assess vulnerability and risk impact.

| Severity | CVSS V3 Score Range | Definition |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0-10.0 | Exploitation is straightforward and usually results in system-level compromise. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch immediately. |
| **High** | 7.0-8.9 | Exploitation is more difficult but could cause elevated privileges and potentially a loss of data or downtime. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch as soon as possible. |
| **Moderate** | 4.0-6.9 | Vulnerabilities exist but are not exploitable or require extra steps such as social engineering. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch after high-priority issues have been resolved. |
| **Low** | 0.1-3.9 | Vulnerabilities are non-exploitable but would reduce an organization's attack surface. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch during the next maintenance window. |
| **Informational** | N/A | No vulnerability exists. Additional information is provided regarding items noticed during testing, strong controls, and additional documentation. |
