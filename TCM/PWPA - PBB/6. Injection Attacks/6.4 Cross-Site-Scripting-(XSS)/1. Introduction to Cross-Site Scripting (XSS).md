## # 🔥 What is XSS?

-  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to **inject malicious scripts** (usually JavaScript) into a trusted website or web application.  

-  When unsuspecting users load the vulnerable page, their browser executes the injected code as if it came from the legitimate site.

-  This can lead to:

	- Stealing cookies / session tokens (account hijacking)
	    
	- Defacing websites
	    
	- Redirecting victims to malicious pages
	    
	- Keylogging & stealing sensitive data
	    
	- Exploiting browser features or pivoting attacks

## 🧩 Types of XSS

There are **three main types**:

### 1️⃣ Stored XSS (Persistent)

- The malicious script is **permanently stored** on the server (e.g., database, comment field, user profile).
    
- Every time someone loads the affected page, the script executes.
    
- **Example**: Posting `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in a forum comment → every visitor sees the popup.
    

⚠️ Dangerous because it spreads to all users.

### 2️⃣ Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent)

- The payload is **reflected immediately** in the HTTP response, without being stored.
    
- Usually delivered via a malicious link.
    
- **Example**:

```php title:php-templete
http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>
```

- If the site echoes `q` directly without sanitization → XSS triggers.
    

⚠️ Typically used in phishing & social engineering.

### 3️⃣ DOM-based XSS

- The vulnerability exists in the **client-side JavaScript (DOM)**, not server-side.
    
- Data from `document.location`, `document.referrer`, or user input is written back to the DOM insecurely.
    
- **Example**:

```javascript title:JavaScript-tempelete
var input = location.hash.substring(1);
document.body.innerHTML = input;  // vulnerable
```

- URL like: `http://example.com/#<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` triggers the payload.
    

⚠️ More stealthy — often missed by traditional scanners.

# 🛡️ Bonus: Sub-types / Variants

- **Self-XSS** → tricking a user into running code in their browser console.
    
- **Mutation XSS (mXSS)** → when sanitizers “clean” input but the browser reinterprets it into executable code.
    
- **Polyglot XSS** → payloads that work in multiple contexts (`<script>`, `<img>`, `<svg>`, JSON, etc.).
