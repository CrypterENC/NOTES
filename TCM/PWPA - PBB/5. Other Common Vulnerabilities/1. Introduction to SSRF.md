### **What is Server Side Request Forgery :**
-  Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that **allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing.** 
- It can be used by an **attacker to interact with internal systems,** possibly bypassing firewalls or accessing unauthorized data.
#### **Simple Example :** 

```
Website: http://site.com/fetch?url=http://google.com
Attack: http://site.com/fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1:8080
Result: Server accesses its own internal port 8080
```

- **The impact of an SSRF vulnerability includes:**
	- Access to internal services and data
	- Remote code execution
	- Denial of Service (DoS)
