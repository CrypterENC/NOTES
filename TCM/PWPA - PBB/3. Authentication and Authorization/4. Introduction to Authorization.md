### **What is Authorization?**
- **Authorization** determines _what an authenticated user is allowed to do_ within the application.  
                                     OR
- **Authorization** is the _process that verifies "What you can access" after authentication has been confirmed._
#### **Key Difference from Authentication:**
- **Authentication**: "Who are you?" → Verifies identity
- **Authorization**: "What can you do?" → Determines permissions
#### **Types of Authorization Models:**

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    
    - Users are assigned roles (Admin, User, Guest)
        
    - Roles have predefined permissions
        
2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
    
    - Access based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions
        
    - More granular than RBAC
        
3. **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**
    
    - Resource owners decide who gets access
        
    - Common in file systems
        
4. **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**
    
    - System-enforced policies (military/government systems)
        

#### **How do Authorization Vulnerabilities Arise?**

- They come from **flawed logic in permission checks** and **failure to properly enforce access controls**.
