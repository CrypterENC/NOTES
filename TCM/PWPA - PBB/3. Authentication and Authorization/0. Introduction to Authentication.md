### **What is Authentication ?** 
-  **Authentication** *identifies the user and confirms that they say who they say they are*.
                               OR
-  **Authentication** is the *process that verifies " Who you are " before granting access to protected resources.* 
#### Types of Authentication used : 
1. HTML form based 
2. Multi-factor based
3. Windows-integrated authentication using NTLM or Kerberos
#### **How does Authentication Vulnerabilities arise ?**
-  It comes **from insecure implementation of the authentication mechanisms in an application.**
#### **Common Authentication Vulnerabilities :** 
1. **Weak Passwords Requirements :**
	-   Having **no or minimal control over the quality of user's password during account creation.**
		- Password being : 
			- Very short or black.
			- Common dictionary words or names.
			- Password is the same as the username.
			- Use of default passowrd.
			- Missing or ineffective MFA.
		-  CASMM

2.  **Improper Restriction of Authentication Attempts :** 
	-  Application **permits brute force or other automated attacks.**
	-  **This happens at :** 
		- Login page
		- OTP / MFA page
		- Change password page
3.  **Verbose Error Message :**
	-  The application **outputs a verbose error message that allows for username enumeration.**

4.  **Vulnerable Transmission of Credentials :**
	-  The **application uses an unencrypted HTTP connection to transmit login credentials.**

5.  **Defects in Multistage Login Mechanism or MFA :**
	-  **Insecure implementation of the MFA Function.**
