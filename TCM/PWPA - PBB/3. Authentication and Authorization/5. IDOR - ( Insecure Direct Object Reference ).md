		" localhost/labs/e0x02.php?account=1009 "
		
1. Check the url " account=1009 ".

2. If we change this to 1008 or 1010, we will be redirected to diff account.

3. We can do FUZZing on the url to find if we are able to do that.
```

                                     OR

-  **You can also use Burp suite to capture the request and change the search query :** 

```markdown

Request = localhost/labs/e0x02.php?account=1009

- We can change the account_number from 1009 to 1010, and check if it does something that is " if we are redirected to diff account. "
  
- Just do FUZZing.
```
