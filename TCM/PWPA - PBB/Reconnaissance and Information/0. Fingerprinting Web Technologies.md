### What is **Fingerprinting** ?
-  **Fingerprinting web technologies is about identifying the exact stack** **(server, framework, language, CMS, WAF, etc.)** behind a target so you can **choose the most relevant vulnerabilities and exploits**

### What you try to learn from **Fingerprinting** ? 

1. **Web server and OS**: Type and version (e.g., Apache 2.4 on Ubuntu), which helps with version‑specific exploits and misconfig checks.
2. **Frameworks/CMS/libraries**: Indicators of WordPress, Laravel, React, etc. so you can pivot into known vulnerabilities and default paths.
3. **WAF/reverse proxies/CDNs**: Presence and product (e.g., Cloudflare, Azure Front Door, Imperva, AWS ALB), which impacts bypass techniques and how noisy you can be.
4. **APIs and sub‑apps**: Separate apps on /api, /admin, or subdomains running different stacks that may be weaker or outdated.
